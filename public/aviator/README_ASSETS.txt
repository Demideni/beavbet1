BeavBet Aviator (BeavJet) assets folder.

You can drop high-quality assets here if you want to replace the built-in canvas vector visuals.

Suggested structure:
- plane/: plane body / flames / shadow (PNG transparent, 2k+)
- bg/: background layers for parallax (PNG, 1920x1080+)
- ui/: buttons, panels, icons (SVG preferred)
- effects/: particles, explosion sprites (PNG)

Current version works without any external assets (drawn via Canvas).
